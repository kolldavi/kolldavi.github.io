description: This is a Rails application called <a href="https://rocky-stream-15179.herokuapp.com/">Dev-Match</a> and is hosted live on Heroku servers. The app supports ecommerce functionality where users can sign up for free or pay a monthly fee and automatically get billed via recurring charges. I also integrated the Sendgrid API to give the application the ability to send out email notifications.
